                <p>An underrated but great spot, Bang Bang comes from the same folks who bring you the fantastic Aalto Lounge happy hour, but this time it’s Thai-influenced. The food menu is full of tasty Thai drinking snacks, including curries and skewers, but our favorite is the phenomenal wings</p>
                <br>
                <p>Happy hour is 5 to 6 p.m., 9:30 p.m. to midnight.</p>

                <h2>The Knock Back</h2>
                <p>The Knock Back encapsulates the idea that bars are primarily supposed to be fun neighborhood spots. There are plenty of great cocktails to choose from, and they’re $2 off during happy hour. Also, wines by the glass, draught beer, and an entire boiler maker menu is $1 cheaper, too, with well-drinks clocking in at $3. HH food includes brussels sprouts ($6), sliders ($4.50), and more, but what’s really great here is the vibe. It’s always a party, and you’re always welcome</p>

                <p>You have to love a place with food this playful, fun, elegant, and thoughtful that still serves $2 Old German tallboys at happy hour. Of course, you could always got for a daily craft cocktail for $7. Whatever you do, don’t miss the tempura green beans in curry sauce for $8, as they are amazing. </p>

                <h2>Interurban</h2>
                <p>Interurban likes to blur the line between bar and restaurant, and serves equally well as both. For happy hour, select cocktails and house wines are just $5, and mugs of beer are available for $4. There’s a nice array of food options on the cheap, but the mini corn-dogs with fries and the much healthier option of grilled broccolini are both standouts at $5.</p>

                <p>There’s no lake anywhere in sight, but there is a great happy hour list that includes, among other things, $1 High-Lifes. If beer isn’t your thing, or if the High-Life isn’t, grab a glass of wine for $3 or a well drink for $4, and if you’re hungry, there are plenty of well-priced quality food items.</p>

                <h2>Paley's Place</h2>
                <p>It’s impossible to overstate the influence that Vitaly "Vito" Paley has had on the Portland, and entire North Western, dining scene. Paley’s Place was the progenitor of our farm-to-table PacNW dining style, and remains a Portland institution. It’s pricey, but that’s why there’s happy hour, where you can sip fine French wine at $5 a glass while snacking on fried duck wings for $8, or get just a simple but exquisite hamburger for only $8.</p>

Bartini delivers over 100 $4 house martinis, from Basilberry to the Diablo with habanero-infused vodka. Dishes of seared ahi tuna and mini crab cakes cost $4, and chicken satay with peanut sauce and shrimp and grits are $7 apiece.</p>

                <h2>Aalto Lounge</h2>
                <p>This happy hour is long-running for a reason: a small but solid menu of $2 cocktails and food. The Belmont Jewel cocktail is bourbon, lemon, pomegranate juice, and orange blossom water, and on the food front, there's a grilled cheese sandwich and oven-baked pretzel. There are also buckets of four beers for $8 to 12 and featured bottles of red and white wine for $10.</p>

                <h2>Dots Cafe</h2>
                <p>Dots Cafe is a Portland institution and has remained relatively unchanged: a cross between a dive bar, a lounge, and a diner. The happy hour menu includes food specials, from the famous fries to healthier options such as salads. Also find $1-off wine, and 50 cents-off beer and well drinks. </p>

                <h2>Slingshot Lounge</h2>
                <p>This unassuming spot near Foster Burger in Southeast serves $1 Olympia drafts during happy hour, plus offers a dollar off a large menu of craft brews. Among blown-up, framed pictures of immaculately tattooed Japanese men, dive into surprisingly fine happy hour food, like a $6 burger. Pinball, pool, and a patio round it out.</p>
