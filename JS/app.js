detailArray.push(["An underrated but great spot, Bang Bang comes from the same folks who bring you the fantastic Aalto Lounge happy hour, but this time it’s Thai-influenced. The food menu is full of tasty Thai drinking snacks, including curries and skewers, but our favorite is the phenomenal wings, only $5 during happy hour and perfect with a Fernet and High-Life or a Bang Bang Old-Fashioned, both of which are only $6 during HH. ", 1]);
detailArray.push(["The Knock Back encapsulates the idea that bars are primarily supposed to be fun neighborhood spots. There are plenty of great cocktails to choose from, and they’re $2 off during happy hour. Also, wines by the glass, draught beer, and an entire boiler maker menu is $1 cheaper, too, with well-drinks clocking in at $3. HH food includes brussels sprouts ($6), sliders ($4.50), and more, but what’s really great here is the vibe. It’s always a party, and you’re always welcome.", 2]);
detailArray.push(["You have to love a place with food this playful, fun, elegant, and thoughtful that still serves $2 Old German tallboys at happy hour. Of course, you could always got for a daily craft cocktail for $7. Whatever you do, don’t miss the tempura green beans in curry sauce for $8, as they are amazing. ", 3]);
detailArray.push(["Interurban likes to blur the line between bar and restaurant, and serves equally well as both. For happy hour, select cocktails and house wines are just $5, and mugs of beer are available for $4. There’s a nice array of food options on the cheap, but the mini corn-dogs with fries and the much healthier option of grilled broccolini are both standouts at $5.", 4]);
detailArray.push(["There’s no lake anywhere in sight, but there is a great happy hour list that includes, among other things, $1 High-Lifes. If beer isn’t your thing, or if the High-Life isn’t, grab a glass of wine for $3 or a well drink for $4, and if you’re hungry, there are plenty of well-priced quality food items.", 5]);
detailArray.push(["It’s impossible to overstate the influence that Vitaly 'Vito' Paley has had on the Portland, and entire North Western, dining scene. Paley’s Place was the progenitor of our farm-to-table PacNW dining style, and remains a Portland institution. It’s pricey, but that’s why there’s happy hour, where you can sip fine French wine at $5 a glass while snacking on fried duck wings for $8, or get just a simple but exquisite hamburger for only $8.", 6]);
detailArray.push(["You're almost certain get a hangover, but that's what a huge selection of half-off “martinis” will do. Bartini delivers over 100 $4 house martinis, from Basilberry to the Diablo with habanero-infused vodka. Dishes of seared ahi tuna and mini crab cakes cost $4, and chicken satay with peanut sauce and shrimp and grits are $7 apiece.", 7]);
detailArray.push(["The old-school RingSide Steakhouse recently upped its prices, but they were so low already that HH remains solid. The restaurant’s steak bites, quarter-pound cheeseburger, and jo-jos all clock in at under $5 (yes, the $2.99 burger is a thing of the past).", 8]);
detailArray.push(["Teardrop Lounge arguably launched the entire craft cocktail bartending scene in Portland and remains as relevant and superb as always with a constantly developing menu full of classics and original drinks. Still, cocktails are expensive, often rising into the double digits.", 9]);
detailArray.push(["The bar at Clyde Common is often packed at happy hour thanks to its menu of $6 cocktails (including favorites like the Bittersweet Symphonic and Spelling Bee) and $3 to $6 snacks. Light snackers can reach for togarashi popcorn; hungrier folks might fare better with the $8 burger.", 10]);
detailArray.push(["Imperial's bar offers its draft cocktails for just $5 each during happy hour (generally featuring the Vieux Carre as a mainstay and another rotating option), as well as a food menu with a dozen discounted options. The superb flat-top burger can be had for $6, which you can pair with some of the city's best fries for an additional $3. ", 11]);
detailArray.push(["Any happy hour list would be remiss if it didn't include the clubby Saucebox. It's just fun. Hip happy hour snacks range from nigiri to chicken pad thai for $2 to 6, and to drink, you'll find three cocktails, read and white wines, and sake for $5, plus dollar off drafts. ", 12]);
detailArray.push(["With its craft cocktails, delicately cooked steaks, and sexy red leather booths, Trifecta is a great place to take your sweetheart for a night of eating, drinking, and, after, some karaoke. But with malt vinegar fries, $6 craft cocktails, and a pretty immaculate pimento double cheeseburger, it’s also a great place to meet up with friends after work. Just know going in that this will be your dinner for the night. ", 13]);
detailArray.push(["Tapalaya brings an eclectic Creole and Cajun happy hour, with discounted cocktails like $4 Hurricanes and $3 martinis. Food includes Asian-influenced plates like boudin egg rolls filled with Cajun rice and pork sausage for $3 and fish sauce wings for $6.", 14]);
detailArray.push(["This happy hour is long-running for a reason: a small but solid menu of $2 cocktails and food. The Belmont Jewel cocktail is bourbon, lemon, pomegranate juice, and orange blossom water, and on the food front, there's a grilled cheese sandwich and oven-baked pretzel. There are also buckets of four beers for $8 to 12 and featured bottles of red and white wine for $10.", 15]);
detailArray.push(["Dots Cafe is a Portland institution and has remained relatively unchanged: a cross between a dive bar, a lounge, and a diner. The happy hour menu includes food specials, from the famous fries to healthier options such as salads. Also find $1-off wine, and 50 cents-off beer and well drinks. ", 16]);
detailArray.push(["This unassuming spot near Foster Burger in Southeast serves $1 Olympia drafts during happy hour, plus offers a dollar off a large menu of craft brews. Among blown-up, framed pictures of immaculately tattooed Japanese men, dive into surprisingly fine happy hour food, like a $6 burger. Pinball, pool, and a patio round it out.", 17]);
